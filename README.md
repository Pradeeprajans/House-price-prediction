House Price Prediction
This project is a machine learning model built to predict house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant factors. The model uses historical data to learn patterns and make accurate price predictions for real estate properties. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Features
Price Prediction: Predicts the price of a house based on input features like area, number of rooms, and location.

Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and relevant features are selected for the model.

Model Training: The model is trained using machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or XGBoost.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared score.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset(s) used for training and testing the model.

model.py: Contains the code for training the model, including preprocessing, feature selection, and model fitting.

app.py: A simple Flask web application to allow users to input house features and get predictions in real-time.

requirements.txt: A list of dependencies required for the project.

notebooks/:

data_exploration.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for exploring and preprocessing the data.
model_training.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the model.
How the Model Works
Data Collection: The dataset used in this project contains various house attributes (size, number of rooms, location, etc.) and their corresponding prices.

Data Preprocessing: The raw data is cleaned, missing values are imputed, and features are engineered to improve model performance.

Model Training: The data is split into training and testing sets. A machine learning algorithm is chosen (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to fit the model on the training data.

Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the house price based on new user inputs.

Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure its accuracy.
